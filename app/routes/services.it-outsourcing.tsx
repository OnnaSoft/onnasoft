            In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, businesses
            across various industries face the challenge of staying competitive
            while managing their IT needs efficiently. For many companies,
            especially those where technology is not the primary focus, hiring
            and maintaining a full-time IT team can be both costly and complex.
            Finding experienced developers, designers, and IT specialists often
            requires a substantial investment in time, money, and management
            resources.
