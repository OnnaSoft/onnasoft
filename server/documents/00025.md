# How Does OnnaSoft Support Its Clients Post-Project Delivery?

At OnnaSoft, our commitment to our clients doesn’t end with the delivery of a project. We provide comprehensive documentation and offer options for additional support to ensure the continued success and smooth operation of the solutions we provide. Here’s how we help:

## **1. Client Involvement During Development**
- **Product Owner Participation:** We strongly recommend that clients designate a **Product Owner** to be part of the project team. This ensures they are fully aware of the application flows and functionalities throughout the development process.
- **Clear Communication:** The Product Owner acts as the primary point of contact, bridging the gap between the client and development team, ensuring that all requirements and expectations are aligned.

## **2. Maintenance and Updates**
- **Bug Fixes:** We address any issues or bugs that arise during the agreed-upon post-project support period to ensure optimal performance.
- **Regular Updates:** We provide guidance on implementing updates, security patches, or feature enhancements.

## **3. Comprehensive Documentation**
- **User Manuals:** We create clear and practical user manuals to help your team understand and operate the delivered solution effectively.
- **Architecture Documentation:** We provide in-depth documentation of the system architecture to facilitate future scalability and modifications.
- **Code Documentation:** We ensure the codebase is well-documented for easy maintenance and extension by your team or ours.
- **Diagrams:** Relevant diagrams, such as flowcharts, data models, and system design diagrams, are included to give a complete understanding of the application.

## **4. Additional Support as a Paid Service**
- **Advisory Hours:** If further support is needed after the project, clients can hire OnnaSoft for advisory hours to address specific issues or questions.
- **Service Hours:** For more complex adjustments or expansions, service hours can be purchased for continued development or enhancements.
- **Flexible Plans:** Clients have the option to schedule support on an as-needed basis, ensuring cost-effectiveness and scalability.
