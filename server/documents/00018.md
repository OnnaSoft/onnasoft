# What Strategies Do We Use to Reduce Costs and Maximize Profits?

At OnnaSoft, we prioritize efficiency and scalability in all aspects of our operations. Our strategies to reduce costs and maximize profits focus on leveraging technology, optimizing resources, and ensuring high-quality deliverables that meet client expectations.

## **1. Leveraging Cloud Technologies**
- **AWS Optimization:** We use AWS services that dynamically scale based on demand, ensuring we only pay for the resources we use.
