# What Contingency Plan Do We Have to Address Financial Crises?

At OnnaSoft, we recognize the importance of being prepared for financial uncertainties. Our contingency plan is designed to ensure business continuity, safeguard key operations, and adapt to changing circumstances during a financial crisis. 

## **1. Building Financial Reserves**
