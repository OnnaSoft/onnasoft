# How Do We Handle Feedback and Performance Evaluations?

At OnnaSoft, we believe effective feedback and performance evaluations are fundamental tools for individual growth, team strengthening, and company success. Our strategy for managing these areas includes:

## **1. Continuous Feedback**
- **One-on-One Meetings:** Team leaders hold regular meetings with each team member to discuss achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** We promote a culture where constructive feedback is shared immediately and directly, fostering continuous improvement.
- **Safe Environment:** We create a space where employees feel comfortable expressing their ideas, concerns, and suggestions without fear of retaliation.

## **2. Structured Performance Evaluations**
- **Biannual or Annual Frequency:** Formal evaluations are conducted at least twice a year, reviewing individual progress based on established goals.
- **KPI-Based Methodology:** Evaluations focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) and specific objectives related to each role.
- **Self-Assessments:** Employees have the opportunity to reflect on their own performance before formal review meetings.

## **3. Support Tools**
- **Digital Systems:** We use tools like Slack, Notion, or Jira to track objectives, projects, and overall employee progress.
- **Anonymous Surveys:** Periodic surveys are conducted to gather general feedback about the company and the work environment.
- **Progress Tracking Dashboards:** Visual systems are available to monitor progress toward both individual and collective goals.

## **4. Individual Development Plans**
- **Corrective Action:** When areas for improvement are identified, we work with employees to create a clear action plan with achievable goals.
- **Recognition of Achievements:** We celebrate individual and team successes to maintain high motivation levels.
- **Additional Training:** We offer training or mentorship opportunities when professional growth requires it.

## **5. Culture of Continuous Improvement**
- **Learning from Feedback:** Feedback is not only for employees; leadership and management also receive input to improve their processes.
- **Closing the Loop:** We ensure that every suggestion or comment received is reviewed and, where possible, implemented.

## **Our Approach**
At OnnaSoft, feedback and performance evaluations are a two-way conversation focused on mutual growth. By maintaining open, structured, and constructive communication, we ensure every team member is aligned with company goals and on a clear path toward their personal and professional development.
