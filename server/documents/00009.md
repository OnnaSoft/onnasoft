# What Is the Vacation and Time-Off Policy?

At OnnaSoft, we believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for our employees' well-being. Our vacation and time-off policy is designed to promote rest, motivation, and productivity.

## **1. Annual Vacation**
- **Vacation Days:** Each employee is entitled to a minimum of 15 paid vacation days per year, in addition to official holidays.
- **Accrual and Usage:** Vacation days are accrued annually and can be used in blocks or flexibly, depending on the employeeâ€™s needs and ongoing projects.
- **Flexible Policy:** We encourage employees to plan vacations in advance to ensure projects remain on track while prioritizing their rest.

## **2. Official Holidays**
- We honor national holidays based on the country where each employee operates, and additional time off is granted for special occasions.

## **3. Birthday Day Off**
- **Day Off:** Every employee is entitled to a paid day off on their birthday to celebrate their special occasion without work-related concerns.
- **Flexibility:** If the birthday falls on a weekend or holiday, the employee may choose a nearby day to take as time off.

## **4. Additional Time Off**
- **Wellness Days:** We offer additional days off for personal or mental health needs.
- **Special Leaves:** In exceptional circumstances, such as maternity/paternity leave, illness, or caregiving, we provide specific leaves in accordance with local regulations.
- **Flexible Hours:** Instead of rigid schedules, we allow flexibility so employees can balance personal and professional responsibilities.

## **5. Remote Work and Breaks**
- **Remote Work Options:** To promote a more comfortable working environment, we offer the possibility of working from home, reducing stress from commuting.
- **Daily Breaks:** We encourage regular short breaks during the day to maintain productivity and physical and mental well-being.

## **6. Philosophy on Rest**
At OnnaSoft, we understand that rest is essential for creativity, problem-solving, and job satisfaction. We strive to create a culture where time off is not only respected but actively encouraged.

While these policies may adapt as the company evolves, our goal will always be to prioritize the well-being of our team and foster a healthy work environment.
