# What Is the Communication Flow Between Teams in the Company?

At OnnaSoft, we believe that effective communication is the foundation of successful collaboration and delivering quality results. For this reason, we have designed a clear and structured communication flow to ensure all teams are aligned and work efficiently.

## **1. Communication Tools**
- **Slack:** Our primary tool for daily communication, organized into specific channels for teams, projects, and general topics.
- **Jira:** We use Jira for project management, task tracking, and updating the status of deliverables.
- **Confluence:** We centralize documentation, process guides, and key notes to ensure all information is accessible.

## **2. Regular Communication**
- **Weekly Meetings:** Each team holds weekly meetings to review progress, resolve blockers, and plan weekly priorities.
- **Cross-Team Reviews:** Interdepartmental teams meet regularly to align goals and coordinate efforts on shared projects.
- **Quick Check-Ins:** We use daily stand-ups when required by projects, particularly in agile development.

## **3. Escalation Communication**
- **Issue Resolution:** If problems or blockers arise, they are escalated promptly to the team leader or management for quick resolution.
- **Progress Updates:** Team leaders report key progress and challenges in leadership meetings to provide a clear overall view.

## **4. Interdisciplinary Collaboration**
- **Shared Channels:** We facilitate interaction between teams through dedicated Slack channels and integration meetings.
- **Collaborative Reviews:** For complex projects, we organize review sessions where all teams contribute ideas and solutions.

## **5. Continuous Feedback**
- **Real-Time Feedback:** We foster a culture where employees can share ideas, suggestions, and concerns immediately.
- **Surveys and Assessments:** We conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on communication and identify areas for improvement.

## **6. Client Communication**
- **Clear Points of Contact:** We designate communication leads for client interactions to ensure clear and consistent messaging.
- **Periodic Updates:** We provide regular reports and meetings with clients to align expectations and maintain transparency.
